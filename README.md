# ![](img/ga.png) SEI-31 Project 0: Tic-Tac-Toe

This was developed as part of SEI 31 Project 0, the goal was to build a web application from scratch, without a starter codebase, and to use programming skills to map out the game logic for a simple game like Tic Tac Toe.

The result for my project is a web app with multiple games such as Sudoku and Tic Tac Toe.

You can play the game [here](https://bennnym.github.io/project0/).
